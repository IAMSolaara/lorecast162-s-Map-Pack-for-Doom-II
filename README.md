# lorecast162-s-Map-Pack-for-Doom-II
This is my map pack for Doom II.  
I'm uploading it here as a temporary measure until moddb authorizes the mod.  
Here is probably gonna be the "cutting edge" branch of the mod, since I will probably post a version with an unfinished level, while on moddb I'm only gonna put finished ones.  
To use it just run the PWAD here with your Boom-compatible source port of choice (it works fine on DOS Boom 2.02, ZDoom 2.8.1, DOS MBF 2.04 and GZDoom 3.2.4).  
Have fun! (that's a good challenge huh)
